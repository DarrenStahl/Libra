Peripherals
===========

Libra has three virtual peripherals connected to it, a screen, a timer,
and a keyboard. These peripherals were chosen to give a basic but useful
set of ways that programs running in Libra can interact with a user.

Documentation on each of the three types of peripheral can be found on
their respective pages.
